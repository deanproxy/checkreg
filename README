This was a simple app created by me to track purchases between my wife and I
before they hit our bank account.  It gives us a way to enter a purchase
immediately after it was done so that the other person could see how much 
was *really* available in the checking account before making a big purchase
of their own.

Sometimes living paycheck to paycheck makes you do funny things...
